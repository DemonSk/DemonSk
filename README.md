# Serhii Ihnatiuk (DemonSk)

Security engineer with 4+ years in secure protocol design and audit leadership. I bridge secure development with offensive security research, focused on real‑world exploitability and measurable risk reduction.

## 🔐 Security Focus
- Smart contract security (EVM & Cairo), protocol design reviews, and exploit analysis
- Oracle design, MEV‑aware risk modeling, and economic attack surface analysis
- Application Security & Secure SDLC (threat modeling, remediation workflows)
- Security reporting, risk communication, and audit‑ready documentation

## 🧰 Tech & Tools
- Languages: TypeScript, Python, Solidity, Cairo  
- Security: Slither, Aderyn, Echidna, Foundry, Hardhat  
- Platforms: Linux, Docker, GitHub Actions  

## ⚡️ AI‑Boosted Productivity
- Use LLMs to accelerate threat modeling and generate attack trees for new protocols
- Automate test scaffolding (Foundry/Hardhat), speed up dev tasks, and reproduce exploit paths faster
- Rapidly summarize audits and convert findings into structured remediation tasks

## 🛠 Developer Experience
- Forked and studied **Prisma Finance**  
- Forked and studied **Aave V3**  
- Forked and studied **Trader Joe V2** (Cairo rewrite)  
- Built on **Boring Vaults** projects  

## 🚧 Current Focus
- Building blockchain applications in production  
- Deepening smart contract security research and offensive testing  
- Expanding into traditional security engineering (AppSec, web security, secure SDLC)
